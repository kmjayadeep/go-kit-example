# Go Kit example

This is an example implementation of go-kit

## Why Go kit?
Go is a great general-purpose language, but microservices require a certain amount of specialized support. RPC safety, system observability, infrastructure integration, even program design â€” Go kit fills in the gaps left by the standard library, and makes Go a first-class language for writing microservices in any organization.
